NOW-QUAL: Vaccine coverage survey Near-time Data Monitoring and Cleaning standard development template
Household surveys are an essential tool for vaccine coverage monitoring in developing countries. Quality
assurance during field data collection is a prerequisite for accurate survey results. However, due to 
the absence of adaptable protocols and tools, the standard of field data quality inspection is 
often insufficient to meet the quality assurance needs. NOW-QUAL (Near-time Oversight with Quality Assistance)
is a user-friendly interface to allow additional near-time inspection of digital captured or entered data 
by a field data monitor without expertise in statistical programming. This Stata-based software template 
is further developed to help future surveyors customize NOW-QUAL for adaptation and wider use.
